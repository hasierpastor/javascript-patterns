//The Module pattern encapsulates “privacy” state and organization using closures.
//It provides a way of wrapping a mix of public and private methods and variables, protecting pieces from leaking into the global scope and accidentally colliding with another developer’s interface.
//With this pattern, only a public API is returned, keeping everything else within the closure private.
//Module pattern imitates the functionality of a class, including private/public methods, and variables inside an object, shielding them from the global scope.
//Very similar to an immediately-invoked functional expression, except that an object is returned rather than a function.
//Used to separate logic and concerns.
